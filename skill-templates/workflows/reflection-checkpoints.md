# Reflection Checkpoints

## Purpose

Force metacognitive pauses at key moments to ensure you're thinking critically about your literature review, not just generating text.

---

## When Checkpoints Trigger

| Moment | Checkpoint | Purpose |
|--------|------------|---------|
| After concept validation | Pre-Synthesis | Confirm direction |
| After literature synthesis | Post-Synthesis | Reflect on findings |
| After first draft | Pre-Audit | Self-assessment |
| After audit | Pre-Submission | Final reflection |

## Skipping Checkpoints

For experienced researchers in Notes tier:

```
/commscribe skip checkpoint

System: "Skipping checkpoint.

Note: Checkpoints are designed to catch issues early.
Skipping may result in more revision later.

Checkpoint skipped. Proceeding to next stage."
```

For Publication tier: Checkpoints cannot be skipped.

---

## Recording Reflections

All checkpoint responses are saved:

```
project/reflections/
├── pre_synthesis.md
├── post_synthesis.md
├── pre_audit.md
└── pre_submission.md
```

**Use:** Review your thinking process; include in methods if relevant.

*Reflection is not a delay. It's how you catch problems before they're expensive.*
